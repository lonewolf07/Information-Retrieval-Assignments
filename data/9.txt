Land Acquisition Bill reunites Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal

Anna Hazare, who had been opposing Kejriwal's political plunge, said it is the second war of independence.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday joined social activist and anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare in his protest at Jantar Mantar against the contentious land ordinance.
Anna Hazare, who had been opposing Kejriwal's political plunge, said it is the second war of independence.
Kejriwal, who was Anna's lieutenant in the anti-corruption movement three years ago, came to the Maharashtra Sadan and met the Gandhian for the first time after the two had gone apart two years ago when AAP was formed.
In a mobile message, the Delhi CM even urged AAP volunteers to come to Jantar Mantar and join the Hazare stir.
Nearly 20, 000 farmers have joined Anna in the protest. Before beginning his protest on Tuesday, Hazare said people from political parties were welcome to join the agitators but he will not share the stage with them. He even made it clear that he would not allow any political colour to the agitation.
"If the political parties come on the stage, then it would appear that it is being done by the party," Anna said.

On Monday, Hazare had said a 'jail-bharo' (fill the jails) movement will be launched from the Ramlila Ground (in new Delhi) after carrying out a 'padyatra' (foot-march) across the country for three-four months.
Accusing the government of only caring for corporates, Hazare said he will not relent till government withdraws the controversial ordinance.
"The political parties are of the country only. And, people running the government are also from the country. The people who suffer injustice are also from this country. And, so if farmers are meted out injustice and if everyine comes together to fight injustice, then what is the problem," Hazare told reporters.
