Anna Hazare to protest against Land Acquisition Bill on Feb. 24

Veteran social activist Anna Hazare on Sunday said that he would stage a protest in the national capital on February 24 against the Land Acquisition Bill and request the government to withdraw the ordinance.

The protest would be organized by the farmer unions.

"This Land Acquisition Bill was passed in 2013, both the BJP and Congress together passed the bill. If 70 percent of the villagers did not want to give land to the industry then that land couldn't be taken. These people removed this provision, and now they say they can take any land. If you take land from the farmers and give to institutions close to you then it is injustice to the farmers," Hazare said while emphasizing the reason for his protest.

"There is a road march in Haryana of around 12,000 to 15,000 farmers who will reach Delhi on 24th. I will go there and show the green flag to that march. Even other farmer organisations will reach Delhi on 24th. I will participate in that movement on 23 and 24. We will request the government to withdraw this anti-farmers ordinance through this movement," he added.

According to reports, social activist Medha Patkar along with 70 other organizations across the country will also be participating in the protest rally to be held on February 24.

The new law, which came into effect from January 1, 2015, will see the owners of land acquired via laws exempted under the act being eligible for a similar compensation.

The ordinance is being brought as the government failed to amend as many as 13 central legislations to bring their rehabilitation and resettlement and compensation provisions at par with those of the new Land Acquisition Act for buying land across the country.
