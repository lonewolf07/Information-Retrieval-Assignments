NDA ally to join Anna’s protests against land acquisition bill
The Swabhimani Paksha, a political arm of a farmers’ organization will join Hazare’s protest march later this month

Swabhimani Paksha, an ally of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) both at the centre and in Maharashtra, will participate in social activist Anna Hazare’s agitation against the land acquisition bill passed by the Lok Sabha last week.

Addressing a press conference in Pune on Monday, Swabhimani’s president and member of Parliament Raju Shetti said, “Even if we are part of the NDA we would not hesitate to take a stand against the government if we feel that the government’s decision is not in the interest of farmers.”

Swabhimani Paksha is a political arm of the farmers’ organization Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana.

Hazare has announced he will lead a protest march beginning from 30 March from Sewagram in Wardha, Maharashtra where Mahtma Gandhi’s ashram is located, to Delhi. The protest has been named Kisan Sangharsh Yatra or the march for farmers’ struggle.
